# custom-skins
This is a repo of custom e-mail skins for OP5 Monitor. Based on [mailgun/transactional-email-templates](https://github.com/mailgun/transactional-email-templates).

## Usage

During development, you can test the skins out by doing the following:
```
cd /opt/monitor/op5/notify && git clone https://github.com/lgrn/custom-skins.git
```
Please note that you need to remove your `custom-skins` directory if it already exists, and if you want it synced via Merlin it needs proper permissions set up on all nodes.
